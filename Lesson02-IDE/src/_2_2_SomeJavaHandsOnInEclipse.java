 * For the hell of it, and in order for me to gauge your basic programming skills, and thoughts,
 *  please create:
 *  
 *  Write a program WordPlay.java that will check a string for being a palindrome. This program 
 *  will need the following considerations and code
 *  
 *  A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or other sequence of units that can be read the same 
 *  way in either direction (the adjustment of punctuation and spaces between words is generally permitted). 
 *  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)

 * In order to achieve this write first, a method returning the first letter of the string
 * 
 * Then write last, a method returning the last character of the string

 * Now write a method, middle, returning the middle part of the string, ie the string without the
 * first and last characters. Hint: Check the Sun/Oracle documentation for the String class and
 * look for substring, a useful method

 * Let me return to the definition, and add that a word of one letter is a palindrome, and a word 
 * of two letters is a palindrome if the two letters are the same. Any word with more than two 
 * characters is a palindrome if the first and last characters are the same, and the middle part 
 * is a palindrome
  
 * That last definition is the pseudo code for a recursive method isPalindrome, having a string as 
 * input and returning a boolean value containing the verdict on the input string. Write that method
 *
 * In order to practice Eclipse behaviour write  WordPlay.java before writing the utility methods.
